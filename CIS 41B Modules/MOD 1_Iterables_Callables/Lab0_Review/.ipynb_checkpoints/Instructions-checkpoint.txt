CIS 41B – Lab 0: Review CIS 41A concepts

Write a program that works with the population census of cities of Santa Clara County.

Input fileThe input file is cities.csv (source). Each line of the file is data for 1 city in Santa Clara.
Each line is in the format:  city name, 2000 census population, 2010 census population, 2020 census population

Lab requirement
Start with the file lab0.py, which already has code to create a class named Cities and code to call the printYear method to print the population of each city in a certain year. The code in main should work as is, you should not have to change it or add to it.

Add the Cities class such that it will read in data from the input file and provide the printYear method.The file should be read in one time only (don’t keep reading the file).

Add exception handing to end the program if the input file can’t be opened successfully.

When printing the year, use formatting so that there are 2 columns of output:   city name     populationAs an optional extra challenge, don’t use an if statement in the printYear method. There’s a more efficient way.
 
Add a docstring for the Cities class and for the public method printYear.

Expected output when the code in main runs:
